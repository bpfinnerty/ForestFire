# ForestFire

This project was to build out a simplified version of Conways Game of Life, named Forest Fire. This game has a number of trees, a direction to the wind and a number of fires.
Every round, trees will grow in the direction where their seeds are blown on the grid. Any tree that is adjacent to an onfire tree burst into flames. Trees already on fire are
burn down. A seed will grow up in the next iteration of the game. The goal of this project was to utilize Mips Assembly to work with memory management and low level commands, as well as test my planning abilities for my code.
